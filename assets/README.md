# Uniloop Asset Origin Tracker

Every 3D mesh, texture, and audio asset in this project is tracked here with its provenance, license/generation parameters, and status.

## Asset pipeline rules

1. **AI-generated 3D meshes**: Reference images generated via `spark-media image` (OpenAI Images API) -> meshes generated via `spark-media mesh --image <reference>` (Hunyuan3D via ComfyUI on Sparky).
2. **Review & acceptance**: Inspect mesh geometry, polycount, and UVs. Acceptable meshes are imported to `assets/models/` and tracked with Git LFS.
3. **Manual fallback**: If an AI-generated mesh is unsuitable (unusable topology, excessive artifacts, poor deformation/collision), substitute a clean Godot primitive (`BoxMesh`, `CylinderMesh`, CSG shape, or simple placeholder), open a GitHub issue labeled `art-asset` titled "Manual 3D asset: <name>", and document the target dimensions, pivot, material needs, poly budget, collision needs, and why generation failed.
4. Broken AI meshes are never shipped as complete art.
5. All binary assets (`.png`, `.jpg`, `.webp`, `.glb`, `.fbx`, `.ogg`, `.wav`) are tracked via Git LFS (`.gitattributes`).
